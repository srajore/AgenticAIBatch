Vision transformer models, unlike conventional deep convolutional network models, leverage a self-attention mechanism to capture global interactions among contextual local elements. This allows them to navigate through image patches effectively, avoiding incorrect correlations and reducing ambiguity in attention maps, thus proving their efficacy in computer vision tasks. Rather than directly analyzing child sexual abuse data, we constructed two datasets: one comprising clean and pornographic images and another with three classes, which additionally include images indicative of pornography, sourced from Reddit and Google Open Images data.
